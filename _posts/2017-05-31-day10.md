#### Docker remote API

Edit the file /lib/systemd/system/docker.service

	sudo vim /lib/systemd/system/docker.service

	ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker daemon -H fd:// -H tcp://0.0.0.0:4243

	systemctl daemon-reload

Restart the Docker service:

	sudo service docker restart

Test that the Docker API is indeed accessible:

	curl http://localhost:4243/version

You should see output similar to this as the result:

	{"Version":"1.11.0","ApiVersion":"1.23","GitCommit":"4dc5990","GoVersion":"go1.5.4","Os":"linux","Arch":"amd64","KernelVersion":"4.4.0-22-generic","BuildTime":"2016-04-13T18:38:59.968579007+00:00"}
